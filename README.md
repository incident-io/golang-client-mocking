# Mocking external client libraries using context.Context

This code is paired with a blog post:

> [Mocking external client libraries using context.Context](https://incident.io/block/mocking-clients)

The post describes a method for mocking external client libraries which can be
applied to most codebases.

It mocks the client using the context parameter, ensuring all code will receive
the same mock for the duration of an operation, and removing the need to
explicitly stub a mock in code that might get called during a test.

We use ginkgo for our test suite, but the technique is independent of test
framework.

To navigate:

- [slackclient/client_test.go](slackclient/client_test.go) is an example test
  that confirms the mock works
- [slackclient/client.go](slackclient/client.go) implements the client wrapper
  and some test helpers
- [.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml) contains the CI configuration,
  including things like checking generated code is up-to-date
- [.gitattributes](.gitattributes) configures GitHub to collapse codegen
  artifacts in PRs by default

An exemplar test might look like this:

```go
var _ = Describe("incident-io/codebase", func() {
  var (
    sc  *mock_slackclient.MockSlackClient
  )

  slackclient.MockSlackClient(&ctx, &sc, nil)

  Describe("some Slack things here", func() {
    // Apply an expectation in the BeforeEach, before the test runs
    BeforeEach(func() {
      sc.EXPECT().GetConversationInfoContext(gomock.Any(), "CH123", false).
        Return(&slack.Channel{
          GroupConversation: slack.GroupConversation{
            Conversation: slack.Conversation{
              NameNormalized: "my-channel",
            },
          },
        }, nil).Times(1)
    })

    Specify("returns a client that responds with the mock", func() {
      client, _ := slackclient.ClientFor(ctx, "OR123")
      channel, _ := client.GetConversationInfoContext(ctx, "CH123", false)

      // We'll only receive this if the client generated by ClientFor is the mock we
      // configured with a fake response in our BeforeEach.
      Expect(channel.NameNormalized).To(Equal("my-channel"))
    })
  })
})
```
